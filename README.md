# **Aeternity Elixir Full Node**

This is an elixir full node implementation of the aeternity specification.


## Docker Container

A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are found in the base directory, prebuilt images are not yet published.

 - Build container `docker build . -t elixir-node`
 - Run node in container `docker run --name elixir-node -it -p 4000:4000 elixir-node`

 - Run multiple nodes network with docker compose `docker-compose up` runs 3 connected nodes, with 2 mining

## Getting started on your local machine

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Required packages

To install and use the Elixir Blockchain you will need [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) (for RocksDB persistence) and the source code by cloning or downloading the repository.

Make sure you have installed the following packages to make sure that the Wallet will work properly:
```bash
sudo apt-get install autoconf autogen libtool libgmp3-dev
wget -O libsodium-src.tar.gz https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.16/libsodium-1.0.16.tar.gz
mkdir libsodium-src && tar -zxf libsodium-src.tar.gz -C libsodium-src --strip-components=1
cd libsodium-src && ./configure && make && make check && sudo make install && cd ..
```

## Usage

#### **Fetching dependencies**
`mix deps.get`

#### **Starting the application**
Start the application in interactive Elixir mode

`iex -S mix phx.server`

#### **Starting the miner**
To start the miner use the following command in the command prompt:

`Miner.resume()`

This will continuously mine new blocks until terminated or suspended.
To suspend/stop the miner from mining:

`Miner.suspend() `

#### **Building custom child Transaction**
To build a custom transaction you need to follow few simple steps:
- Make your own `transaction module`
- Create your `custom transaction structure`
- Override the `Transaction Behaviour` callbacks
- Write all your specific functions and checks inside your new `Transaction module`

All custom transactions are childs to the `DataTx` Transaction that wraps them inside.
The DataTx strucure hold:
- The name of your `transaction type` that should be you `Transaction Module name`
- The `payload` that will hold your `custom transaction structure`
- `sender`, `fee` and `nonce`

  Body: **serialized_tx**

  Where *serialized_tx* is json serialized signed transaction structure

- To post new block to the chain:

  `POST localhost:4000/block`

  Body: **serialized_block**

  Where *serialized_block* is a json serialized block structure

- To get all transactions for an account

  `GET localhost:4000/tx/{account}`

  Where *account* is a hex encoded public key

- To get a block by hash

  `GET localhost:4000/block/{block_hash}`

  `GET localhost:4000/balance/{account}`

  Where *account* is a hex encoded public key

- To get the transaction pool of an account:

  `GET localhost:4000/tx_pool/{account}`

  Where *account* is a hex encoded public key

### Running the tests

To run the automatic tests:

`mix test`

### Logging

To debug, see errors, warnings and info about the blockchain,
the log can be found in the source folder under:`apps/aecore/logs`

`09:59:16.298 [info] Added block #1 with hash 6C449AC3B5E38857DC85310873979F45992270BF54304B3F60BE4F64373991B5, total tokens: 100 `

`09:59:16.298 [info] Mined block #1, difficulty target 1, nonce 4`

#### **Oracle usage**
**TTL (time to live):**
  Determines the lifetime of an object measured in blocks, it can be either absolute
  or relative (absolute - the object is removed when a block with a height equal to the TTL is mined;
  relative - the object is removed when a block with height equal to the TTL + block height in which the transaction was included is mined). A TTL is defined like so - %{ttl: value, type: :relative | :absolute}

**Registering an oracle:**
  `Aecore.Oracle.Oracle.register(query_format, response_format, query_fee, fee, ttl)`
  The query and response formats are treated as json schemas by which the queries and responses
  are validated. The query fee is the minimum fee that will be required for queries made to the
  oracle. If the oracle responds to the query on time, he will receive that fee as a compensation
  for the response fee he had to pay.

  example format schema -
    ```
    %{
      "type" =>
        "object",
      "properties" => %{
        "base" => %{
          "type" =>
          "string"
        },
        "date" => %{
          "type" =>
            "string"
        },
        "rates" => %{
          "type" =>
            "object"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  To list all registered oracles -  `Chain.registered_oracles()`

**Querying an oracle:**
  `Oracle.query(oracle_address, query_data, query_fee, fee, query_ttl, response_ttl)`
  The query TTL determines the time in which the oracle is able to respond, if he doesn't respond in time, the account making the query will get the query_fee back. The response TTL determines for how long the response will remain in the state after it is added, this TTL can only be relative.

  example query -
  ```
  Oracle.query(
    "ak$5oyDtV2JbBpZxTCS5JacVfPQHKjxCdoRaxRS93tPHcwvqTtyvz",
    %{
      "currency" =>
        "USD"
     },
     5,
     10,
     %{ttl: 10, type: :absolute},
     %{ttl: 5, type: :relative}
  )
  ```

**Respond to a query:**
  `Oracle.respond(query_id, response, fee)`
  Responds to a query which is referenced by ID, if the response is added successfully, the oracle receives the query_fee contained in the query.

**Extend a registered oracle:**
  `Oracle.extend(ttl, fee)`
  Extends the TTL of an oracle with the address that matches the address of the node.

All transactions have to be mined in order to take effect.
